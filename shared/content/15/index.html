            Let’s get practical and think about it…
        </h2>
        <p>Suppose you are the owner of a summer cinema, the only one in your town. Currently, 200 tickets are sold each Saturday at a price of 5€ each. Your business partner suggests you raise the price to 7€ per ticket.</p>
        <p>Before giving an answer, you have carried out a study on the elasticity of demand for your consumers and have estimated that they have an elasticity of -2.</p>

                    <p>Taking this into account, is it a good idea to raise the price of your movie tickets?</p>

                <p>Please argue your answer and assess the economic effect this rise will have on total income.</p>
