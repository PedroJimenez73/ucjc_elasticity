            Effects of a sales tax
        </h2>
        <h3>Letâ€™s think about the effects of a sales tax...</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="fade-uno">What effect does a sales tax have on equilibrium prices and quantity as well as on tax revenue?.</li>
            <li class="fade-dos">Are the equilibrium price and quantity dependent on whether the government collects a specific tax from the suppliers or their customers?</li>
            <li class="fade-tres">Is it true, as many people claim, that producers pass along to customers any taxes collected from producers? That is, do consumers pay the entire tax?</li>
            <li class="fade-cuatro">Do comparable ad valorem and specific taxes have equivalent effects on equilibrium prices and quantities and on tax revenue?</li>
        </ol>
